# CPE-CPU - A 32 Bit RV32I Processor
Designed by Patrick Hoey - UML


# General Notes
* Design Concepts
** For R-Type Instructions
*** ALU Design - Appendix A
*** Multiported Register Deisgn - Appendix A.8
** For J-Type Instructions
*** Need to sign extend 12 bit jump instructions - figure 4.8 pg 247
**** Offset field is shifted left 1 bit to allow higher range of jump
*** Determine branch jump instruction - determine conditional - follow correct path
** Control Logic - pg 251 ch. 4.4
*** Break down the control logic into sub control blocks (ex. ALU control module)
